#Files are here. make a new with name of language. Not important just a name


word in language start = [english, russian, german, and so on]
makes a new var with that name. No repetition of vars so use words once.
	worda = []
	2 use 
		worda = [] not accepted. Would use worda the second time as worda stuff.
		


#Now the sys
	enList[1,2,3,4,5]

#	if adding word, use new word in say any space, use same space in Russian and German. ADD already will do this for you as soon as I add ADD def and make it
